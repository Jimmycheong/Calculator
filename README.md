My Very first calculator program! 

- Written in Python 3
- Uses the Tkinter module for GUI development 
- Took me about 4 hours to build v1.0
- Feel free to fork this repository or copy the 'calculator.py' file for personal use. 
- Run this through either IDLE or through terminal, whatever suits you! 

What I learnt: 
- How to use OOP to build a program
- How to import images using the 'pillow' module
- How to use the grid manager effectively 
- How to write callback functions
- How to bind keyboard and mouse events

Potential Future Updates: 
- More functions such: temp storage, cube etc. 
- Better styling
